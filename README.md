# Image_classification-on-custom-dataset 
For that project, I first create a new dataset containing four classes. Then, I pre-processed the dataset and split the whole dataset into training, testing, and validation portion. After that, I applied a deep learning algorithm (CNN), sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and Adam optimization technique and achieved an excellent training and validation result.
